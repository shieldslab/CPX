# While Loop Examples

While loop syntax:
```
while [a statement that will evaluate to true or false]:
     # code that will run while the statement is true
     
# this code will not run until the while loop above it is done
```

For loop syntax:
```
for thisThing in biggerThing:
     # this code will run through the bigger thing
     # as it does, each item in the bigger thing is thisThing
     
# this code will not run until the for loop above it is done
```
Example:
``` 
for letter in "potato":
     print(letter)
```
will print
```
p
o
t
a
t
o
```
